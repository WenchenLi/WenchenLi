title: Work with people

I experience a lot of collaborations during this semester, projects in the class as well as works at GTRI. Most of them works great, but one of them makes me really uncomfortable.I'm not here to complain but to summarize what I learned from this experience and how to avoid this in the future. 

<!--break-->

Always respect my teammates, people in the team may have different understanding on a specific field, whenever they have different opinion and even negate my thoughts, I should discuss with them until we are more like on the same page before this discussion if we are in a small team. 

<!--break-->

Keep everyone has this good chemistry within this team. Everyone should feels like one can always learn from each other instead of think other people are not as good as oneself.

<!--break-->

Good Communication Skill is necessary to connect people's mind.

Manage a team is not easy. It is an art involve everything.You expertise in the field, the way you organize the team as a whole, a little bit psychology, a little bit about perceiving people's gesture and expression. It's really hard for a manager to precisely manage a team.( What if we come up with some manage tools or software that can help us quantify this conveniently and precisely?)

<!--break-->

When you feels not comfortable working with someone in the team, talk to him/her first to better understand what leads to the current situation. If it is really hard to solve, avoid further cooperation. 

<!--break-->

A team works as a whole share the same or relative similar vision, has the same working pace, respect each other.I mean this is the place inspires creativity and productivity. I hope in not long from now on, I can find this place.
