title: Wake up! My dream says
---
If someday I wake up but I don't have that courage to fight, I know I need to change something, something that wakes up my inner voice, woke up my startup dream. To fight for the benefit for everyone through cutting edge technology, to fight to help everyone save even a little bit of time because I improve the efficiency of the system, to fight to fundamentally improve the quality of people's life because I come up with an great idea and successfully implement it.

<!--break-->

Stay hungry, Stay foolish.There are a lot of things to do and improve. My time is limited given I will be cleared away not so far from now. I want to ride on this wave in deep learning "revolution" to achieve the state of the art results which will be utilized to change people's life.
