title: Thoughts on Collaborative Filtering
---
Recently I implemented a recommendation system based on the Collaborative Filtering, my references are [Andrew's introductory on CF](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/) and
[prof.Joseph A Konstan and prof.Michael D Ekstrand's recommendation system](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems), but those are not using deep learning, I googled and find [recommendation based on RBM](http://www.ismir2011.ismir.net/papers/PS6-13.pdf) [another one] (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amnih/papers/rbmcf.pdf) [another one](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/netflixICML.pdf),[CF using deep learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2944v1.pdf) and [music recommendation using deep learning](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5004-deep-content-based-music-recommendation.pdf) and here is a related [spotify blog](http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html).
I will explain more here what I've found after reading these papers.
