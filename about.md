Hi, I'm currently a CS master student @ [Gatech](http://www.cc.gatech.edu) focusing on Machine Learning.Previously I studied actuarial science @ [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu) and computational mathematics @ [Mathematics School & Institute of Jilin University](http://math.jlu.edu.cn/).

For now I'm working with [Dr.Alan Wagner](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~alanwags/) and [Dr.Zsolt Kira](http://www.zsoltkira.com/) on implementing Deep segment project to perform real time scenes recognition and navigation for the blind and robot. Some initial result can be found [here](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/52410/Doshi_gtTechReport.pdf?sequence=1), I'll also be responsible in implementing on the Google Glass side of this project.

I love to code agents that can help with people's everyday life. Optimizing not only my own life but also everyones' is my end goal. This world needs people to make the cake bigger more than people only thinking of getting bigger chunk of a fixed size cake.

I believe Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence is the direction to help.
