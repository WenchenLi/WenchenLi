Hi, I'm currently a CS master student @ Gatech focusing on interactive intelligence and software engineering.Previously I studied computational mathematics @ Jilin University. 
### More Information
I love to create things that have help with people's everyday life. If my service can help people save x minutes in their daily life, I'd love to challenge the upper bound of x with never give up learning and creating.
I believe Artificial Intelligence is a great field that can help me to achieve my goal. Systems built with AI algorithms performs more intelligently and interactively with human. This can help people save a lot of time when interact with the intelligent agents.
