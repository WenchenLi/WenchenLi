Hi, I'm currently a CS master student @ [Gatech](http://www.cc.gatech.edu) focusing on interactive intelligence and software engineering.Previously I studied actuarial science @ [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu) and computational mathematics @ [Mathematics School & Institute of Jilin University](http://math.jlu.edu.cn/).

For now I'm working with [Dr.Alan Wagner](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~alanwags/) and [Dr.Zsolt Kira](http://www.zsoltkira.com/) on implementing Deep segment project to perform real time results(some initial result can be found [here](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/52410/Doshi_gtTechReport.pdf?sequence=1), I'll also be responsible in implementing on the Google Glass side.

I love to create things that have help with people's everyday life. If my service can help people save x minutes in their daily life, I'd love to challenge the upper bound of x with never give up learning and creating.
I believe Artificial Intelligence is a great field that can help me to achieve my goal. Systems built with AI algorithms performs more intelligently and interactively with human. This can help people save a lot of time when interact with the intelligent agents.
