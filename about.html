    <h1>About me</h1>

<p>I holds a CS master on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence from College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology. Previously I studied actuarial science at Columbia University and computational mathematics at Mathematics School and Institute of Jilin University.</p> 

<p>I'm broadly interested in mathematical model of the intelligent systems and how those models fit the working solutions of Vision, Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning related problems.</p>

<p>I'm thriving by understanding the problem deeply through coding the intelligent systems up , as well as explaining them well through writing this blog.</p>
